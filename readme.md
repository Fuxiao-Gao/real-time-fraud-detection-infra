# Real-Time Fraud Detection Dashboard

This repository contains the **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** for a real-time fraud detection pipeline built on **AWS**, designed to simulate real-world scenarios by ingesting live social media data from **Bluesky**.

> **Note:** This repository includes only the Terraform and Terragrunt code for provisioning the infrastructure. The actual data processing scripts, SageMaker inference logic, and image automation pipeline are located in a **separate repository** .

---

## Project Highlights

- **Real-Time Fraud Detection:**  
  Utilizes **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** and **AWS Lambda** for ingesting and transforming social media text, images, and video data in real-time.

- **Machine Learning Inference:**  
  Streams are routed to **Amazon SageMaker** models for live inference, detecting fraudulent patterns with sub-second latency â€” supporting up to **3,000 records per minute**.

- **Data Persistence and Offline Analysis:**  
  Processed results and media assets are delivered to **Amazon S3** via **Kinesis Firehose** in Parquet format for long-term storage and batch analytics.

- **Monitoring and Observability:**  
  **Amazon CloudWatch** is used to track real-time metrics, monitor pipeline health, and visualize dashboards for operational transparency.

- **Infrastructure Automation:**  
  Entire AWS infrastructure is provisioned and managed using **Terraform** and **Terragrunt**, with **GitHub Actions** enabling CI/CD pipelines for consistent, reproducible deployments.

## Repository Structure

This repository includes:

- Terragrunt-based IaC modules for:
  - VPC, Lambda, ECS, ECR, S3, Kinesis, Firehose, Glue, CloudWatch, and SageMakers
- Environments structured under `live/dev/`
- CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions (workflow files)

---

## Sensitive Information and Workflow Logs

- GitHub Actions workflows were intentionally **deleted after execution**. This is due to the possibility of **Terragrunt outputs exposing sensitive information** such as:
  - AWS Account ID
  - Resource ARNs (e.g., S3 buckets, Lambda functions)

While GitHub Actions provides masking capabilities, logs can still unintentionally reveal details through AWS error messages or infrastructure outputs.

## Decoupled Design: Infrastructure vs. Business Logic

This repo contains **only the infrastructure code**.

> The **actual business logic** (i.e., fraud detection algorithms, media processing scripts, and Dockerized model runners) is stored in a **separate private repository**.

### Why Decouple?

- **Security:** Keeps sensitive model code and secrets isolated from public view.
- **Testability:** Allows separate development/testing of infrastructure vs. ML logic.
- **Reusability:** Makes infrastructure reusable across other use cases or teams.
- **CI/CD Simplicity:** Easier to build targeted deployment workflows for infra vs. app code.

##  Requirements

- Terraform 1.5+
- Terragrunt 0.48+
- AWS CLI with appropriate IAM permissions

---

## Usage
- To deploy the infra, run Deploy the IaC in AWS workflow and configure proper secrets.
- To destroy the infra, run Destroy the IaC in AWS workflow and configure proper secrets.
